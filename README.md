# Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling

Welcome to the Interactive Data Analysis Acoustic Modeling Platform, a comprehensive program designed to facilitate the analysis, cleaning, and modeling of audio data. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for importing data from various sources, cleaning it by handling missing values and inconsistencies, and performing in-depth data analysis to uncover valuable insights. The toolkit excels in handling data formatting issues, such as converting audio files from mp3 to wav format, ensuring seamless integration into your analysis pipeline.

This platform is designed to enable users to seamlessly import, clean, visualize, analyze, and model data
using scientific calculations and data visualization tools.

To start, simply press the "open file" button on our platform's GUI and select a wav or mp3 file from your files. That's it, it is that simple, once a file has beem selected our platform will begin analyzing and displaying all the important data from the file.
